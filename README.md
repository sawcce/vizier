# Vizier

Easy to use,  statically typed, versatile and general purpose programming language

## Motivations

Whereas in languages like rust and c++, things get quite confusing for beginners,
I'm aiming with vizier, to create a language that provides all the necessary tools for 
creating complex programs while relying on simple and permissive yet predictable 
patterns and concepts.

## Build the project

To build the project you need to have cmake installed, and some platform dependent tools
such as MinGW on Windows for everything to run correctly.

If you encounter any errors feel free to make an issue or
